AI-Assisted Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling Framework
 Overview

Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is widely used to reduce power consumption by adjusting CPU frequency according to workload demands.

However, traditional DVFS mechanisms are reactive — they respond only to current CPU load. This often leads to:

Sudden frequency spikes

Thermal overshoot

Power instability

Oscillatory behavior

Delayed response to workload bursts

This project proposes a lightweight AI-assisted, thermal-aware DVFS controller that improves stability, responsiveness, and hardware safety.

 Core Idea

Predict short-term workload and apply thermal constraints before adjusting frequency.

Instead of reacting to the present workload, the system anticipates near-future demand and integrates temperature rise trends into its decision-making process.

 Implementation Details
1️ Workload Prediction (ML Layer)

Model: Linear Regression

Input: Current CPU Load

Output: Predicted Next CPU Load

This makes the controller proactive instead of reactive.

2️ Temperature Trend Monitoring

Temperature rise is calculated as:

Temp_Rise = Current_Temperature − Previous_Temperature


If temperature increases rapidly, frequency boosting is restricted.

This prevents:

Thermal spikes

Overheating

Emergency throttling

3️ Constrained DVFS Controller

Frequency decisions depend on:

Predicted workload

Temperature rise rate

Maximum frequency limit

Gradual ramp-up / ramp-down

This ensures:

Smooth frequency transitions

Reduced oscillations

Hardware-safe operation

 Existing Research & Related Work

DVFS has been extensively studied in power-aware computing research.

🔹 Traditional Rule-Based DVFS

Operating systems commonly use threshold-based policies:

If load high → increase frequency  
If load low → decrease frequency


While simple and efficient, these methods are purely reactive and may cause frequent oscillations.

🔹 Control-Theoretic Approaches

Some research models DVFS using feedback control (e.g., PID controllers) to smooth transitions.
These improve stability but still rely on reactive signals.

🔹 Prediction-Based Techniques

Research has explored:

Time-series models (AR, ARMA)

Kalman filtering

Neural network workload predictors

While effective, complex models increase computational overhead and may not suit embedded systems.

🔹 Thermal-Aware DVFS

Advanced approaches integrate thermal modeling to prevent overheating.
However, many systems treat thermal and predictive mechanisms separately.
